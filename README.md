# Shop-Shop

### Description

This e-commerce site is a full stack MERN application. MERN is a acronym for MongoDB, Express, React, Node. Other tools used to build this application include GraphQL, Redux, Bcrypt, JWT, Apollo, and the Stripe API.

The site functions the same as any other e-commerce site. You must sign up or login in order to checkout. You can add, update, remove items from your cart from either the homepage or product page. Once you have the items you want in your cart, checkout is processed through Stripe. If you wish to test out the checkout process you can enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 as a test credit card.
